# Suggested Improvements

These are prioritized ideas for enhancing the project and making it more suitable for building dashboards and web applications.

1. **Automated Testing Across Python and Angular**
   - Introduce Python unit tests using `pytest`.
   - Configure GitHub Actions (or another CI) to run Angular and Python tests automatically.
2. **Containerized Development Environment**
   - Provide a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose` setup for running both Angular and Python services.
   - Simplifies local development and deployment.
3. **User Authentication**
   - Add a simple auth layer (e.g., JWT) for the websocket and API endpoints.
   - Helps secure dashboards when hosted.
4. **Real-time Data Integration**
   - Expand `BokehService` to consume real-time data feeds and update plots dynamically.
5. **Responsive Layouts**
   - Improve Angular components to support responsive design and theming for use in complex dashboards.
